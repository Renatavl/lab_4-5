# Announcement service

The "Announcement Service" is a platform for creating, managing, and sharing announcements with a two-tier message system. Users can perform CRUD operations on both local announcements, accessible only to users within the same location, and public announcements, visible to everyone, including non-service users. Providing a flexible solution for personalized and community-wide communication, this platform ensures efficient information sharing on both local and global scales.

## ðŸª„Main Features

    - Users can create announcements of two types: local and public.

2. **View Announcements via Link:**
    - You can easily share each announcement with others using a special link, making it simple for everyone to access and spread the word.

3. **Edit Announcements:**
    - Users can change what they wrote in their announcements whenever they want.

4. **Delete Announcements:**

```
Replace <variant_number> with the desired variant number. This API endpoint will respond with a JSON message containing the greeting.
